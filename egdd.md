## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

- Float around map 
- Shoot projectiles
- Projectiles and Balls collide
- Player/Balls overlap hoops to earn points
- Player and Balls overlap to lose points

# Learning Aspects

- Quick decision making
- Risk/Reward deduction due to punishing scoring structure
- Predicting object trajectory from two objects colliding

*Describe what kinds of formal and informal learning contexts this will be used in (e.g., courses, k-12 computer labs during free time).*

## Learning Objectives

- Assess which scoring method would net more points/benefit for each hoop
- Apply trajectory mapping to score using the collision mechanic 
- Recognize when to take the safe, lesser scoring option to not lose points
- Prioritize long-term scoring by utilizing risk-reward assesment
